# 2.0.0

* **Upgraded** to `seamless-immutable` version `7.0.1`.


# 1.1.5

* **Fixed** bug where `__defineNonEnumerable` was showing up on immutable objects as an enumerable property.


# 1.1.4

* **Fixed** default export to monkey patch immutable objects in a way that keeps Ember from trying to add properties to them, which results in an exception. This allows immutable objects to be directly referenced in templates and computed properties.

* **Fixed** build to publish.

# 1.1.2

* **Updated** CI to test in Chrome as well as Firefox.


# 1.1.1

# 1.1.0

* **Added** additional builds to CI to make sure addon works with latest versions of Ember.
* **Removed** files from npm package that aren't necessary (all of the various config files).
* **Updated** dependencies to latest versions.


# 1.0.1

* **Updated** Travis configuration to test addon against older versions of Ember.



# 1.0.0

* **Added** missing dependency.
